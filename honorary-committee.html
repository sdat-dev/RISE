                                                            home, school, and business in the state, SUNY is the nation’s largest comprehensive system of public higher education. It serves more than 1.3 million students annually, employs more than 90,000
                                                            faculty and staff, and connects more than three million alumni around the world.</p>

                                                            America. Dr. Johnson grew the company from one plant to 19 plants on 10 rivers in five eastern states—enough to power 150,000 homes with clean energy. Prior to Cube Hydro, Dr. Johnson served
                                                            as Under Secretary of Energy at the U.S. Department of Energy. As Under Secretary, she was responsible for unifying and managing a broad $10.5 billion energy and environment portfolio, including
                                                            an additional $37 billion in energy and environment investments from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009.</p>

                                                            for the Future," and bolstered leadership in research, new initiatives, and graduate programs. This planning process also included&nbsp;creating the Mosaic Initiative to recruit outstanding under-represented
                                                            faculty, launching the Discovery Grant Program for faculty-led initiatives, and successfully managing the university’s ten-year accreditation review.</p>

                                                            led the recruitment of many prominent faculty to the university and oversaw a significant increase in the number of faculty hired to develop and enhance strengths in key areas of research and
                                                            scholarly activity. As a result, the university achieved substantial increases in research expenditures and federally awarded research grants, putting UB in league with the top national research

                                                            to enrich the educational experiences of UB undergraduate students by introducing programs designed to provide them with opportunities to engage in learning and research with UB’s top faculty.
                                                            He also oversaw the development of innovative “living-learning environments” constructed as part of “Building UB,” the university’s comprehensive physical plan.</p>

                                                            Since Dr. Tripathi assumed the presidency in 2011, the university has also opened five major building projects on its three campuses, celebrated a $40 million bequest that is the largest gift
