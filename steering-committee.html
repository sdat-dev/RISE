                                                        <p>Jacob Mans is an architect and educator focused on understanding the feedback loops between building-scaled technical systems and large-scaled social and ecological systems. As architects and architectural
                                                            researchers, we often describe these systems, and study them independently from one another. The reality is that architecture collects, channels, and distributes energy and materials across these
                                                            immense, powerful and interconnected socio-technical systems. He believes architecture should ask questions and engage in critical inquiries that affect immense change rather than prioritizing
                                                            research on the incremental improvement of preexisting architectural questions. Within a socio-technical research framework, a building can no longer be the sole scale of response to the question

                                                            2019.&nbsp;
                                                        </p>

                                                        <p>As the longest serving chair in University’s Department of Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences (DAES) history, Thorncroft has been instrumental in building upon UAlbany’s rich and celebrated history
                                                            in atmospheric sciences. Over the years, he has forged a close working relationship between ASRC and DAES faculty, staff and students – a major catalyst in UAlbany strengthening its reputation
                                                            in weather and climate science and achieving record levels of extramural research funding.</p>

                                                        <p>Thorncroft also spearheaded the UAlbany SUNY 2020 weather and climate research strategic plan, co-led the NYS Center of Excellence in Atmospheric and Environmental Prediction and Innovation and co-championed
                                                            the NYS Mesonet – the most advanced weather observation system of its kind. Overall, his crucial leadership role helped to establish the largest weather and climate enterprise in New York and
                                                            one of the most prominent in the nation.</p>

                                                        <p>His major research focus is on improving understanding of the processes that determine the nature and variability of the West African monsoon, including how this impacts Atlantic tropical cyclone
                                                            activity. He has also had leadership roles in several field campaigns in the West African and Tropical Atlantic regions.</p>

                                                        <p>Thorncroft earned his Ph.D. in meteorology from the University of Reading in Berkshire, England in 1988, and spent over a decade at the university following his graduation as a fellow and lecturer.
                                                            He joined UAlbany’s DAES faculty in 2001.</p>
